## 👤 About Me

I'm a self-taught developer with a passion for building practical tech solutions that address real-world challenges. Coming from a unique background, my path in tech is defined by resilience, self-discipline, and a drive to learn continuously. I take pride in having completed several projects from initial concept to full deployment.  
My work spans web development, data engineering, and machine learning, tailored to help organisations and charities achieve meaningful impact.

## 💼 Professional Background

Currently, I volunteer with a charity supporting employment for individuals post-incarceration, where I work on tech and data projects to support this mission. My experience includes navigating the judicial and prison systems, which has deepened my understanding of how technology can drive rehabilitation and social impact.
