## 👤 About Me

I'm a self-taught developer with a passion for building practical tech solutions that address real-world challenges. Coming from a unique background, my path in tech is defined by resilience, self-discipline, and a drive to learn continuously. I take pride in having completed several projects from initial concept to full deployment.  
My work spans web development, data engineering, and machine learning, tailored to help organisations and charities achieve meaningful impact.

## 💼 Professional Background

Currently, I volunteer with a charity supporting employment for individuals post-incarceration, where I work on tech and data projects to support this mission. My experience includes navigating the judicial and prison systems, which has deepened my understanding of how technology can drive rehabilitation and social impact.

# 🔧 Key Projects

## 🌐 Funding Assistant: A Web-Based Funding Application Generator
https://fundingassistant.xyz

**Objective**: Streamline the grant application process by using RAG \(Retrieval-Augmented Generation\) and a custom vector database to embed previous question-answer data.

- This application reads previous funding applications, categorises content, and retrieves relevant data to generate new answers based on the set requirements.
- Features a local language model server to prioritise data privacy and cost savings.

## 💼 Inside Job Charity Job Portal
https://insidejobsearch.xyz

**Objective**: Enhance employment access through a job portal that scrapes over 20,000 job listings daily, with elasticsearch (fuzzyness and synonyms) and location filtering.

- Powered by Django and Elasticsearch, this portal offers comprehensive search features, including custom analysers for precise job title matching and adjustable fuzziness.
- Includes location filtering, making it an essential tool for localising employment opportunities.
